PEER to PEER communication using UART.Implementing peer-to-peer communication using UART involves setting up two microcontrollers to communicate directly with each other via their UART interfaces. This requires connecting the transmit (TX) pin of one microcontroller to the receive (RX) pin of the other, and vice versa, along with connecting their grounds. Both microcontrollers must be configured with the same UART settings, such as baud rate, data bits, parity, and stop bits. For instance, using Arduino microcontrollers, one can write a program for the sender microcontroller to initialize UART communication and send a message periodically. The receiver microcontroller is programmed to continuously check for incoming data, read it, and optionally send a response back. This setup allows both devices to exchange data efficiently, enabling applications like sensor data sharing or control commands in a seamless, bidirectional manner.
